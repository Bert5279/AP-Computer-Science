I do not love but hate this bad restaurant, sincerely.I love brunch, Italian Kitchen, in downtown Vancouver, has created an Italian brunch menu that will surpass your expectations. Each item is curated with quality, nuances of perfect freshness, and boasts flavour that will make your heart happy. Chef Matteo is a genius! The dishes come together beautifully, each bite tasting as if it was curated decadence. I experienced this in each brunch item I chose to try.The staff and management are pretty amazing too, as is the ambiance. Overall, the experience will leave you feeling as though you are the most important customer, a feeling everyone deserves when they dine at a truly magnificent restaurant. A 2021 Travellerâ€™s choice award winner, by Trip Advisor, this place is a must for true brunchers.
